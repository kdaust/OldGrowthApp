## About this site
This site maps British Columbia's old growth forests based on publicly-available provincial data. Map layers and data provide a strategic-level vision of the state of our forests for use in regional planning. The data behind the maps are available by request. 
## What is Old Growth?
structurally complex natural ecosystems generated by a landscape’s natural disturbance regime. In wet regions where wildfire is rare, forests can be much older than the oldest trees, with complex structure driven by gap dynamics. In more frequently disturbed ecosystems, tree age is more uniform, with veteran large trees representing legacies from the past. Given time, structural complexity creates myriad habitats that support diverse communities;  hence, retaining old-growth is important for maintaining biodiversity. As well as assisting humans to mitigate and adapt to climate change, intact old growth forest delivers crucial ecosystem services including clean water, clean air, food, medicines, materials, cultural resources, spiritual values and recreational opportunities  
### Types of Old Growth
Old growth forests vary with climate, topography, soil, disturbance history and age. Forest types look and feel very different; they function differently and provide different habitats and cultural resources.
Some sites can be highly productive, growing large trees quickly--the type of forest most people envision as old growth. Other sites are less productive, growing small trees slowly. While many subalpine and bog forests are very old, they do not support the massive trees and complex structure of valley-bottom rainforest.
## BC Old Growth status
About a quarter of BC's forest is currently old growth. Most of this forest consists of small trees that have not been economical to log. Only a small proportion (about 3%) of BC's remaining old growth supports large trees. Highly productive sites are naturally rare. These forests have been targeted by logging and have dwindled to a tiny proportion of their past extent. 
## At Risk Old Growth
Many old growth ecosystems have been reduced sufficiently far that near-term risk of irreversible biodiversity loss is high. Maps show highly productive old growth, ancient forests, rare forests and intact watersheds.
## Forest Resilience
the ability of an ecosystem to absorb, recover from and adapt to disturbance.  In an era of increasing natural disturbance due to climate change coupled with increased anthropogenic disturbance, resilience will determine whether systems remain in states that provide the full suite of ecosystem services, or whether systems undergo regime shifts to new states with lower diversity and different functions. Evidence strongly supports a relationship between forest resilience, ecosystem function and biodiversity at multiple scales (including species diversity, genetic variability and regional pools of species and ecosystems).  Resilience is also influenced by ecosystem condition (e.g., large unroaded patches of forest and unblocked streams are more resilient to disturbance) and by the condition of the surrounding landscape. Resilience of particular species increases when sufficient habitat exists to avoid fragmentation and provide source populations.
## Forest Carbon
Trees accumulate carbon over long time periods. When they die, much of their carbon is stored in soil for centuries and millennia. Live and dead trees, along with forest soil, store the equivalent of 80% of the carbon currently in the atmosphere. The largest trees store the most carbon.
The most productive forests store the most carbon. 
Maintaining old carbon-dense forest in wet, highly productive forests is an effective climate mitigation strategy because these forests store vast amounts of carbon. Harvesting old forests releases carbon into the atmosphere, with 40 – 66% lost in the first 5 years after harvest. More is lost through processing, meaning that “long-lived wood products” store a quarter or less of the carbon in a standing forest. Harvesting forests for bioenergy emits more carbon than using fossil fuel sources because combustion and processing efficiencies for wood are less than coal and forest takes times to grow back
